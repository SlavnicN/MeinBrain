# EIP 4337

The EIP specify:
    - The smartcontract entrypoint
    - The differente method that the smartcontract wallet need to implement
    - notion of decentralization bundlers, it's a node that send the bundle tx
        to the Entrypoint.handleOps()
        => Since it's not native to ETH protocol, you need to run a node to 
            do bundle the userOperation R


- UserOperation new struct => pseudo-tx that has all the info for the tx to be
    send on the behalf of the user
- alt mempool => Waiting room for UserOperation to be executed
- Eth node can bundle userOperation in the alt mempool to be executed at the 
    time 
- This bundle of userOperation is send to a single smartContract "EntryPoint" and
    call the function handleOps
