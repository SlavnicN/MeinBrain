# Append-Only Storage
- Have a separate smart contract only for storage that we herite in the imp smartcontract
- It's append-only so you can't delete
- Modification is done on a new contract v2 which will herit from the v1
- Need to put dummy value if you want to update the v1 and you are already on v3 lets say
