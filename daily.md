- Lunching demo on commit 2f70f09184446b374f6c96978bae19389933b89e
- seems not to work out of the box with test 20-21-22
- seems that the smartcontract are stuck in a certain state, when I launch the
    recovery on a new account it's stuck in "waiting answer equal"
- if I wait then the recorvery start again.
- launched a new agent and it's the same, it's stuck on "waiting answer equal"
- waiting for the second agent to recevie the boadcast
