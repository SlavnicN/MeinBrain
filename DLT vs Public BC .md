# DLT vs Public BC 

DLT:
    - Need to be given access to and identified
    - Different security consensus
    - Allow faster transaction than a public one
    - Closer to a classical DB

Useful:
    - For scaling up a public decentralised environement (closer to a db)
    - Confidentiality 
    - Governance, grant or remove access
