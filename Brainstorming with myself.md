# Brainstorming with myself

- What to do next:
    - Smartcontract dev
    - Protocol blockchain dev 
    - embedded dev 
    - crypto dev 
    - manager

- Is it not just a fantasy for me, I think I want that because it's shiny but 
do I a realy want to do dev. Am I actually good at it ? I like the idea but 
I'm not sure i'm doing it like really dev stuff and I doubt that I am good 
What does it mean being good at it
