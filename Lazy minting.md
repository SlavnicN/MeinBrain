# Lazy minting
- Action of minting the nft done when purchase and not creation. 
- It's the buyer who will pay the fees and not the issure/creater of the NFT
- The fees are integrated in the buy TX 
- Make it easier for NFT creator to submit there work without paying anything
and not being stress on if they will recover that money if they sell the NFT or not
