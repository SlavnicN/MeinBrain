# XDai Gnosis chain

- stable side chain EVM, secure by a proof of stack of a particular token
- can deploy smartcontract on it 
- xDai peg 1:1 to Dai stable coin 
- To get xDai you need to get it throug a bridge from xDai
- Dont' need eth to send tx
- 1 Tx < 5s => 60TPS
- STAKE token for the POS

- DPOS:
    - Delegated POS

- Bridge: TokenBridge


DAPPCON22

- use DAI to pay all fee on xDai chain
- stake token = GNO 
- xDai chain = GnosisChain
- Gnosis Beacon chain (merge of Gnosis Beacon chain and execution layer TBD)


- 10-15% of missed block because of how much this is decentrlized
- Lido/Kraken/Binance centrlized, same issue has ethereum
- Bridge = Gloryfied multisig, still a point of failure in ETH ecosystem
- [futuer] ZKP bridge between Gnosis and Eth for trustless bridge
    combine zk-evm + zk-light-clien to secrure bridge ETH/GCB

- blocksize = 100m and 5s blocktime

- [future] want to go to private transaction
