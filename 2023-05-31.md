Yousov: 

- Lunching demo on commit 2f70f09184446b374f6c96978bae19389933b89e
- seems not to work out of the box with test 20-21-22
- seems that the smartcontract are stuck in a certain state, when I launch the
    recovery on a new account it's stuck in "waiting answer equal"
- if I wait then the recorvery start again.
- launched a new agent and it's the same, it's stuck on "waiting answer equal"
- waiting for the second agent to recevie the boadcast 
- Work with test5-6-7 but had to wait all the agent to get out of the loops
- recompiled and redeployed sc 
- [optional] verify sc on tenderly
- add new contract in the .configenv
- [next] need to create 3 new user with one with EZ[[2023-06-01]]
