# PayInnov Questions


- What is the link of a user and PayInnov
    - Do a user(buyer) need to create a account in payInnov ?
    - What info does the QR code contain? Is it specific to a crypto/address 
        or generic to the vendor 
        
 
- QR code scanning and payment are independante of payInnov application 

    
//- Do you have a different backend implementation specific to each crypto or generic one





- What frameworks do you use for Frontend/Backend?

- In the dashboard, what is the link between the buyer and the transaction, 
    only wallet, some ID, TX hash ? 
- When is the the link done between the user and the transaction?
    If the user send crypto through his wallet there is no interaction with 
    payInnov at that stage or any sending of the tx hash
- Can you maybe provide us a simple workflow with the api related to better understand this part
    
- How are the transaction tracked in the dashboard ? 
    - based on the TX hash, the backend send requests to the blockchain to get the info?
        In that case, when and how is the TX hash send to payInnov and how is it link to a user(buyer)
    - or is it a listener on a certain wallet address(vendor) that update the dashboard on 
        change 

- Do a user(buyer) need mobile app(and/or an account) payInnov to scan the 
    QR code and connect to the wallet available on the mobile
