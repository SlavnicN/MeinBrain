## Biography
-  My natural love for logic game, researching, understand thing to there core obviously drove me to the path 
of science, math, computer science... But it's later in my student life that I came across programming and 
espacially cryptography that I felt in love with the field. I started my dev journey in a company providing Smart Card Identity Card, 
that involved a lot of security and cryptograpy. I learnt a lot during this time and it helped me structure my
work and my though in a very strict way (find better phrasing) since the position allowed me to work on sensitve
part. Many year later, it's through the lens of cryptography (and not cryptocurrency ;) ) that I discoverd blockchain
technology, I found that field amazing and it never left me since, always lurking article, self learning bits
here and there till I decieded I wanted to go full in into that field and add my stone the this giant edifice (???)
And it's where I discovered Eniblock which aligned perfectly with what I was looking in a company and what I wanted
to develope. And so I became an Eniblocker !
