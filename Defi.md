# Defi

- Traditional CEX you have a market maker that put a price on goods and put an order
    on a tx. This order is place in an Order book and once the criteria are met 
    sells it.

- in DEX, you have liquidity provider that replenish a pool of token with a pair 
    (ex ETH-wETH) and the DEX will automatically manage that 
    (with an Automated Maker Market), there is no need to put a price before hands 
    on the goods.

- There are a lot of different AMM, for instant UNISWAP use a Constant model that 
    will always provide liquidity no matter the size of the order or the size of 
    the pool
