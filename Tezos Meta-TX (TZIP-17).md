# Tezos Meta-TX (TZIP-17)
- The goal is to provid a sort of gas station for the user, that way he won't pay any fee during a transaction but a relayer will (Eniblock)
- This is done by signing some data with the private key of the user and send it to the relayer
- Can be maybe used for lazy minting
- Can think of a way to create a Eniblock token and the user will use that instead of paying fees
