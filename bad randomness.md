# bad randomness

- crypot in the blockchain cannot generate secure randomness, hashes could be manipulated by miner
- everything is public in the blockchain so a random number could be store only at the end of a lottery ?
- Computer are faster than the blockchain and it could precompute the random before the blockchain
=> Use commit-reveal mech or verifiable delay function
