- Allow fix if bug found in a smartcontract
- Easely add new feature to existing smartcontract

BUT 
- Technicaly complexe
- Add centralization(Why due to an admin that do the update ?) 

=> Ugrade a smartcontract by modifying the code excecuted while keeping
the storage of the smartcontract intacte
