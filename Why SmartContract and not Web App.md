# Why SmartContract and not Web App
- Here we trust the program instead of a admin or dev or operator (Do not entirely agree on that, dev develop the smartcontract too, so that in fanlinve so need to really dig the doc of a project to know what's behind)
- we can verify the code smartcontract, everything is public so can easily verify if there are fraud or "hidden" code
