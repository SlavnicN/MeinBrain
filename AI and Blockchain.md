# AI and Blockchain


🌐🚀Web3TalentFair Paris 2023: Exploring the latest advancements in #Blockchain, #AI, and #Web3!

Metadev3 had the immense honor of being invited to this fascinating summit. The event was a deep dive into the latest advancements, with enlightening talks on the transition from Web2 to Web3, the rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), and empowering role of women in the Web3 industry.

We were also privileged to participate in a round table discussion on the intersection of AI and blockchain, contributing to the dialogue on this constantly evolving field that holds the potential to shape our digital future.

🤝 We had the privilege of interacting with innovative projects such as Builda and Payconsent. These interactions were incredibly stimulating, highlighting the ingenuity and innovation that characterize the blockchain domain.

📚 A big shout out to everyone who contributed to these enriching discussions. Your passion and dedication are truly inspiring.

🎉 A huge thank you to Benoît for his invitation and for facilitating these exciting exchanges. His warm welcome made this experience even more memorable for Metadev3.

Together, we can build a more transparent, secure, and inclusive digital future. Metadev3 looks forward to what the future holds!




Question:

- How could blockchain developer leverage AI ? 
    - Growing technologie, hard to keep up -> help get the essential
    - More and more codeless SDK, innovation, it's hard to keep up 
        and we are overwelhmed by all the information and we tend to go
        to the shinner objet, because theire marketing team did an excellent job
        look at how big polygon became. Even now it's still unclear what position 
        there are taking, Side chain, layer 2, Polygon 2 ...
        Having a AI model to scrap all the information form a projet can help get
        the real infromation faster, and not alny base our judgement on only
        what there are giving us in the front page or the documentation. 
        Down side is for know the info from chatGPT/Bard are sometime not accurate
        or with fantom answer so we need to know the subjet very well upfront to 
        use it efficintly

    - debug
    - security audit
    - included in docs (polygon, eth, algorand, tezos...) with everything 
        (github, smarctontract, issue...), discord... 

- Near future improvement ? 
    - Interactive documentation
    - Intelegent and automated summary (DAO)
    - Networking monitoring

- Enhanced monitoring
    - solve problem of actual monitoring: 
        - automate manual work
        - work faster on bigger data set
        - more precise overtime 

    - Can be more precise over time to monitor transaction on a BC than
        legacy monitoring system. Can learn over time with more and more
        data.
            - identify suspicious transaction
            - monitor risk (level of confidence in a transaction based on
                several factore like age of the account, tx history, location...)
                Can prevent fraudulent activites
            - Fraud dectection, it could identify pattern of previous
                fraud and scan for future potential fraud and flag them

Security: 
    - Neural Cryptography
        - One of the limitation from most know bc is the implementation of 
        the cryptographic part in them, it's a fix algorithm (ECDSA) that sign
        and verify transaction. Quantium computer are already a risk takin in
        seriously, NIST is finishing standerdizing the next algo quantum proof
        so how will blockchain be impacted 
        (https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/risk/articles/quantum-risk-to-the-ethereum-blockchain.html)
        Not only blockchain impacted but here we could imagine to replace a fix 
        algorithm by a neural crypto secure all the tx on a blockchain making 
        hard to break and could adapte if anything is descovered in the future
    - Privacy-preserving ML
        - Add privacy to blockchain tx 

Topic to speak about: 

- Network of AI model in blokchain: SingularityNET
- Security audit

Use case: 

- AI Prompting
    - help develop faster
    - self security audit

- Analyses of fraudulent/illegal activity

- Render Networ

Project:

- SingularityNET
    - Network of AI, global brain, 
- fetch.ai
- Missio.ai
    - Summaryze complexe DAO proposal
