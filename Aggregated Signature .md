# Aggregated Signature 


- Scheme that have 4 different componenent
    - Keygen
    - Sign
    - Combine
    - Verify

The differences is that you can take n message and pk to Combine() them to generate
    one signature s. The Verify() then take n message pk and the s to verify that 
    all signature are good
