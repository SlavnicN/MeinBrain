# eSov Idea

- instead of having a false questions system, it would be better to have 
    a reputation system that is updated for each question distributed. Auto 
    regulated score and no need to send false tx. 

- Instead of question, having your key send to a number of agent and and adjust
    the reputation system by there reactivity 

- Use a DPKI scheme to cipher communication among user/agent, cipher/decipher 
    questions from users

- Precalculated answer/question credits, in order to make it instant fast
